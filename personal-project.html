					<p id= "description">Hi, my name is Jack and I live in BC, Canada. When I was growing up I always had a fascination towords how the world works. I always felt the need to crack things open to finally understand them. This curiosity led me towards a coding course I took in grade 9. This course opened my eyes to the possibility of understanding even the most complicated of consumer electronics. From their I began learning simple electronics after i was introduced to arduino microcontrollers. These micro-controllers gave me the ability to visualize my code in a way I wasn't able to before. before long I became interested in 3d design and purchased my first 3d printer, a creality ender 3. With this printer I was able to combine multiple skillsets in order to create what my mind came up with. Now, in order to complete another skillset, I am learning web-design. I hope that this will help me invision new projects that can keep up with the moving world! (the photo is a filler, not me!) </p>
